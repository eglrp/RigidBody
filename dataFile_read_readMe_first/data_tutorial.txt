//A small tutorial of this game
//This file defines the scenario of the simulation
//It contains world settings and all shapes in the beginning
//Use "//" to creat a comment line, but you must start A NEW LINE to comment
//
//
//How to use those buttons in this game:
//There are 3 buttons: Drag, Poly, Circle(sorry, Circle is not finished)
//  Drag:
//    Click on a shape and drag.
//
//  Polygon:
//    Left click to creat a series of vertex,
//    And RIGHT CLICK to finish
//    IMPORTANT: alway creat vertice in anticlock-wise order.
//    IMPORTANT: and make sure the polygon is convexe
//
//How to write this scenario file:
//  You need to set those following values:
//
//  gravity: 0 -9.81
//          |
//          |
//  always keep a space between name and number

gravity: 0 -10



//simulation speed

speed: 0.5



//frames per second
//For your information, the deltaTime of simulation, dt=1/frequency*speed
//If you find your game lags try to reduce it
//(often caused by slow drawing speed of Imagine++)

frequency: 30



//set 1 if you wish to see the mechanism of the contact	solving
//(THATS VERY INTERESTING)

debug: 0   



//And don't forget to end this setting

endsetting


//As of below, we construct the shapes of our game
//Types of shape:
//Polygon, Circle, Rect, Square
//
//--------Shared Properties between all the shapes:----
//mass or density
//vel         (velocity)
//ang_vel     (angular velocity)
//restitution (=1 means elastic collision)
//friction
//move        (translation) 
//rotate
//fix(means fix to the backgroud)
//
//---------Specific properties:-----------
//Polygon: vertex
//Circle:  center, radius
//Rect:    center, width, height
//Square:  center, side
